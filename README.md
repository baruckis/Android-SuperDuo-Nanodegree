### Android Developer Nanodegree Project: Super Duo


## Project description:

###Project Overview

You will productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library. 

###Why this Project?

Super Duo gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems in a pair of apps and also practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love. 

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over. 

###What Will I Learn?

In this project, you will: 
* Diagnose existing issues with an app. 
* Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
* Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries. 
* Handle error cases in Android. 
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.
